The Azimuth is a post-moonlord melee weapon that deals low base damage.
<br>
The Azimuth shoots 5 jester arrows from above, and 5 starfury projectiles
<br>
from below, which each deal 2500 base damage.
<br>
The Azimuth is crafted from 10 Zenithite Bars and 50 fallen stars at
<br>
an ancient manipulator.
